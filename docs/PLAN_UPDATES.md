# Incremental plan updates

## 2026-11-02 — Parallel E2E web execution plan

Full parallel plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-11-02-parallel-e2e-web.md`  
Ledger: `docs/notes/EXECUTION_LEDGER.txt`  
iOS handshake: `docs/IOS_AGENT.md`

Waves:
- **A** (parallel): contracts, web scaffold, API scaffold, normalize data, strip solar, iOS handshake
- **B** (parallel after A): predictor, planner, verification, PRT card, map shell, IndexedDB
- **C** (parallel after B core): calendar, day schedule, Grok helper, X signals, E2E runbook

Product non-goals for this build: solar/PV/materials/energy UI; `apps/ios/` edits; training new ML from raw GPS.

## 2026-11-02 — Grok Bot + calendar + PRT-style UI + confidence bands

Added to the base Buzz Route spec:

- **In-app Grok Bot helper** (web first): “Hey Grok, using my calendar, when should I leave for the next event?”  
  Uses Google Calendar connector (next event only for now). Separate iOS Grok Bot handles mobile deployment later. Same backend tools.

- **PRT-style segmented plan card**:  
  Walk to stop → wait → ride → (optional transfer walk + wait + ride) → final walk.  
  Shows duration per segment + total ETA + `p_on_time`.

- **Accuracy bounds that widen with horizon**:  
  Near-term (bus < ~3 min): tight p10–p90, high confidence.  
  Far-term (≥ 60–90 min): wider bands + explicit “check again closer to departure” message.  
  Driven by Monte Carlo sampling over the Stinger Delay quantiles.

All numbers still come exclusively from the deterministic `TripTrace`. Verification required before display or speech.
